Does data accessibility have an impact on climate change?

# Title: Analysis of the Impact of Data Accessibility on Environmental Performance Index (EPI)

## Introduction

This case study examines the impact of information accessibility on the Environmental Performance Index (EPI) of countries, focusing particularly on the relationship between access to environmental data and the effectiveness of climate policies.

## Background

The EPI, initially developed by researchers at Yale and Columbia Universities in 2006, aims to measure and compare the environmental performance of nations worldwide. Intrigued by how information influences environmental policies, I decided to link data accessibility to climate change.

## Methodology

I began by extracting EPI data, which I adjusted for consistency with existing data accessibility metrics. I chose to focus my analysis on countries with a GDP above $1,500, allowing me to concentrate on nations with relatively stable economies.

## Results

**Overall Correlation**: I observed a positive correlation between data accessibility and EPI scores, suggesting that countries facilitating access to environmental information tend to perform better ecologically.

**Impact of GDP on EPI**: Excluding low-GDP countries highlighted this correlation, whereas removing high-GDP nations from the analysis revealed a negligible influence of data accessibility on EPI.

Following this, the analysis of high-GDP countries revealed a negligible influence.

## Discussion

The findings indicate a significant role for information access in improving environmental performance, primarily in middle- and high-income countries. This suggests that, for low-income countries, other challenges may take precedence before information access becomes a lever for environmental performance.

## Conclusion and Implications

This study underscores the critical importance of data accessibility in enhancing countries' EPI, highlighting the role public policies can play in promoting this access. It also points to the need for tailored strategies for low-income countries to help them improve their environmental performance.
